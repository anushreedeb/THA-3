Research question: What are IMR  and CMR  rates for India?

Dataset: DHS India 2015 -16. 

The Demographic and Health Survey, administered by the DHS Program, is funded by the USAID and conducts locally administered health and demographic surveys across several countries.  In India, the DHS Surveys are administered under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, coordinated by the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, and implemented by groups of survey organizations.  Within DHS, I have specifically looked at DHS_Birth Recode, which looks at health and demographic data for infants and children. The .dta file has been renamed to birth_recode for ease of use. I will use variables from the dataset to generate new variables to calculate IMR and CMR.
